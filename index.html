<p>Also known as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://susguywhy.github.io/ptb.html">PTB </a>(Push-The-Button), this project attempts to allow a group of devices to act together to push a ‘charge’ button on a 2007 Ford Escape Hybrid. This code was written during the summer of 2024 (August to be exact) and was incrementally improved for a month to get to its current stage. After trial and error, the code for this project will be offered to the public free of charge and you can modify and distribute this code as long as you don't commercialize it.
