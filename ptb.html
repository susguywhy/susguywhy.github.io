<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I live (Nevada) about some 2000+ miles away from my parents back home. I recently purchased a vehicle which is one model year newer than the current vehicle that I am driving; a 2008 Ford Escape V6 (no more Hybrids, and you'll come to learn why)… The vehicle that this project is intended for is a 2007 Ford Escape Hybrid but I think it is applicable to all first generation Ford Escape Hybrids along with the first (one or two) year(s) of the second generation Ford Escape Hybrids; you need to have "the button.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><strong>History</strong>…</i></p>
<p>The 2007 Ford Escape hybrid, from what I think, is a fairly good vehicle. Granted, when I purchased this vehicle, It had a bit less than 60,000 miles on the Odometer. It was locally owned by a Nevada business. I guess, I may be a bit biased when it comes to this vehicle so I'll just provide you with what I have experienced with my 2007 Ford Escape Hybrid and spare you my opinions of the vehicle as they are neutral at this point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've owned this vehicle for 3 years and during these four years, I've had to replace the 12V DC car battery twice due to the Nevada heat and age of the original battery that came with the car. I've also upgraded the Low-beam headlights with some LED bulbs (which have not failed yet…) I don't remember the brand and I'm a bit lazy to look it up on Amazon – I think it costs me just $100 sometime in 2022, when I first acquired the vehicle. I've changed the motor oil every 3000-4000 miles and I also changed the eCVT fluid around 70,000 miles. I used an ATF (Automatic Trans. Fluid) from Valvoline (red bottle) at the time. This is a 2WD variant so I did not do anything with Rear Axles or PTU as they don't have these components (as far as I know). Other than these items, nothing else was done to this vehicle – it has been reliable for me during my time of ownership so far…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Except when the HVTB (High-voltage Traction Batter) started to deteriorate and gave me more grief when it came to reliability. With 79,000 miles on the odometer, it got to the point where I'd keep a Battery Jump Pack (12V) in the trunk just to boost the 12V Car battery enough to charge the HVTB. If I let this car sit for two days without driving it (for at least 20 minutes), the HVTB would not have sufficient charge to start the engine and I would not be able to go anywhere. A fun fact about this car – it had a recovery button to instruct the computer to charge the HVTB from the 12V car battery with a push of a button (even without the key in the ignition). Apparently, this was a feature that was left in by Ford to allow the owner a way of starting their vehicle if it sat for a long period of time. I don't believe the car had a conventional starter and instead relied on the HVTB to start the gasoline engine (a 2.3L Atkinson-cycle 4 cylinder engine)… some more basic information on how this vehicle worked can be found at this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://auto.howstuffworks.com/ford-escape.htm">link</a>. Anyway, way before this (I'd say for about a year and a half), the vehicle would experience, what I call, tremors and slow accelerator response. This typically happened when the car was started after sitting for at least several days and it would require you to step on the gas pedal fully in order to get the car to move at reasonable speeds. Turning at an intersection took a little more skill as you had to floor the gas pedal ahead of time (by about 2 seconds) for the gasoline engine to realize you really need help. Also kinda dangerous…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This prompted me to start looking at getting rid of the hybrid and into a more reliable car. I thought about another hybrid vehicle since the fuel efficiency was there but in the Nevada heat, the batteries are really cooked and abused and I think this was what caused the problems I described above. I decided to purchase a used 2008 Ford Escape XLT v6 with 4WD after looking on several marketplaces online – this wasn't my first choice but it was a convenient one for me as I was already familiar with the Ford Escape. I originally purchased the ‘08 Ford Escape so that I could sell or give away the Hybrid. However, I realized that travel back to see my folks and renting a vehicle when i got there is expensive and costly. Especially, during the holidays, when I would normally visit. I decided to ship the Hybrid back to my folks to store in their garage and to use when I came home to visit. This naturally lead to the question of how to deal with the HVTB while I'm away from my parents. This is where, after consulting with a few colleagues and throwing different ideas away, the idea to use a computer board to periodically “press” the charge button in the Hybrid so that the HVTB would not be left at zero for prolonged periods, was the born.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><strong>The Idea</strong>…</i></p>
<p>The Hybrid had a 12V AGM battery and is connected to a trickle charger (2A) to maintain the battery. Charging the HVTB involved pressing a button by the driver-side footwell and waiting up to 8 minutes for the computer to charge the HVTB from the 12V car battery. After the charge was completed, the HVTB would be at a sufficient level of charge to permit you to start the gasoline engine. Once the gasoline engine started, the HVTB battery would be charged by the car's alternator (I think…)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><strong>How</strong>…</i></p>
<p>So the trickiest part of this project, I think, was to build a physical platform for the “button-presser” to rest on and since the Charge button was also mounted vertically on the driver-side foot well, there wasn't a good place to mount a plunger-type device or even have leverage to slide an object into the button… this was probably overkill but I ultimately decided to use a servo with a tiny arm mounted to the cog. The servo would be mounted against a piece of metal bracket with a metal-wire tie (I think it was literally copper wire) and the metal bracket would be screwed down onto a wooden platform. This wooden platform would fit the driver-side footwell and provide the stability needed when the servo activated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Computer board chosen was the Arduino R4 WIFI; I needed a WIFI enabled board to monitor several parameters such as the voltage of the 12V battery and also track the amount of times the button is pressed remotely, while I was back in Nevada. Surprisingly, the Arduino Cloud offers this feature to me with little cost (I think I settled for a second-highest package for 30/year). In addition to the Arduino and the Servo, a current and voltage sensor was also used; a module with the INA226 was used to measure the voltage from the car battery. Conveniently enough, the cigarette lighter in the Hybrid is wired directly to the car's 12V battery, so I purchased a cigarette plug to barrel jack adapter along with some (female) pigtails and wired everything on a small breadboard. I also wired in an LED (which I had left over from my days in school) to a GPIO pin to give some indication of operation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><strong>Update</strong>…</i></p>
<p>So, I switched out the Arduino R4 WIFI for an Arduino Nano 33 IoT board. This board appeared a little more primative compared to the Arduino R4 but from a Cloud-usage perspective, I couldn't tell the difference (except maybe the load times). The smaller computer board did present some minor challenges (as it wasn't a direct drop-in replacement for the R4) but these were overcome quickly due to access to numerous libraries available for the Arduino ecosystem. The code that is published is a direct copy-and-paste from the online IDE that was used for development – so If you want this to work right “out of the box”, I suggest you copy and paste the source file into a blank ‘sketch’ in your Arduino Cloud account and fill in the blanks (Such as WIFI info and some cloud variables). The cloud variables are provided below and the dashboard I've created will allow you to visualize the 12V battery voltage along with several buttons to initiate actions on the Nano board such as Pushing-the-Button (charge HVTB) and resetting the board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><strong>Some details of the code</strong>…</i></p>
<p>I've included a auto reset feature in the code for when the WIFI goes out; it should allow at least 5 minutes before the system is rebooted. I found out during development that the board will not attempt to reconnect once the connection goes out so I needed a way for the board to automatically detect this condition and initiate a reboot… You'll see from the schematic that there's a wire going from one of the pins directly to the RESET pin of the Arduino Nano.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the Arduino Nano would reboot numerous times a day when it was placed into the driver-side footwell... I didn't have too much time to debug this issue as I was in a time crunch to get back to Nevada, So i instrumented the usage of NTP and some flash memory to store the last time the charge button was pressed and the uptime of the system to determine if it was time to ‘press-the-button’.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The loss of WIFI issue could have probably been easily remedied with some extra code to watch for a disconnect and to retry but at the time, I'm not familiar with WIFI and the Arduino WIFI Library so I opted for a crude solution… As with the spurious reboots, I'm still working on that… will try to find the culprit when I am back at my parents' again.</p>
